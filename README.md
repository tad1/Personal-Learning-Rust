# Learning-Rust
roadmap for learning rust, created by [tad1](https://github.com/tad1)  
*I created that to learn rust by myself.*

## Stage 0: Fork
Fork this repo, so you can, even more, brag about your GitHub profile to the interviewer.

## Stage 1: Learn
*a stage where you are getting know about Rust*  
  
Go, and clone [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).  
Create a list (you can use ...) where you will write down keywords of what your learned along with [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) (see an [example](/Somewhat%20List.md)).


## Stage 2: Recall
*a stage where you are getting used to Rust*  
Review your list of what you learned.

*a stage where I yeet wood logs into you, and you are ... (doing some sort of acrobatics?)*</br>
